EXERCISE 7.
Linked lists VS Arrays.

-   What are the differences between linked lists
	and arrays for queues and stacks?:

One difference is that when creating an array, you have to 
declare the size of the array, that is you have to know
how many elements you want the array to hold. This undynamic
behavior of arrays is also a problem if your array gets filled.

A linked list can grow to the size you need, but when 
using an array you have to create a function that creates a new
bigger array and copies all the elements to new one, this increases
running time while inserting.

The linked list on the other hand has a sentinel which takes up
memory. If you have a lot of small lists the memory taken up by
the sentinel can be non trivial. Linked Lists can simplify the code
and make it easier to read and understand.

-    When is it preferable to use which data structure?:

Arrays are best to use when the number of elements are known,
when making many smaller lists with few elements and/or when
memory is in short supply. Linked list are good to use when
the number of elements is unkown or when using data structures
with a lot of elements in every structure. The use of Linked
Lists can also make the code easier to read and understand.
