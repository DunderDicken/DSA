EXERCISE 4:
Activity Manager


-	The function 'DFS()' is implemented in the files 'Graph.h' and 'Graph.c'
-	The test is implemented in the function 'EX4()' in the file 'test.c'
-	The test is called from the main function in the file 'main.c'

The algorithm I used for this excerice is DFS. This will give information about discovery time,finishing 
time and predeccessor of all the nodes in the graph. These times are added to a list as recomended by 
the book (p. 613). This test mimic the graph from the lab and the list is printed in the EX4() function.
I don't know how to write a good test for this so i printed the results and they are correct for the graph.
