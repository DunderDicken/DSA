EXERCISE 5.
Queue with an array.

- The queue is implemented in the files "Queue.h" and "Queue.c".
- The tests for the queue operations are implemented in the file "testOperations.c".
- The tests are implemented in the function "testQueueArray()".   

The queue structs and functions for both excercise 4 and 5 are in these files,
it is the "-QueueArray" struct and functions that is a part of this exercise.

The test is written in the function "testLinkedList()", and uncommenting it in
the main() function of the file "testOperations().c" will run the test. The 
test is dependent on the predefined value "NUM_TEST", wich will determine how 
big the queue is and how many numbers will be enqueued to it.

This was one of the harder exercises to get right, especially the circular
function. Because of this I wrote a lot of small test with just a couple of 
elements that I tried to enqueue and dequeue, for this I stepped through with
the debugger.

After this I wrote the test function "testQueueArray()". This test follows 
the instuctions in the lab manual:

• Use dequeue on an empty queue (underflow error).
• Enqueue a few items and then dequeue them. Confirm that the output order
  is the same as the input order.
• Enqueue elements until the internal array is completely filled and 
enqueue another element (overflow error).

There is comments throughout the test to explain what is tested and how. 
The test is only suppose to print something to the output if anything
goes wrong, except in the end of the test.
