EXERCISE 8.
Asymptotic Complexity of Sorting Algorothms.


Choose the best algorithm (among Insertion Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort) to use in the
following cases:

• The input array is sorted in ascending order;

Insertion sort, best case is O(n) and occurs when the array is already sorted in correct order.


• The input array is sorted in descending order;

Merge sort, which has the best worst-case complexity, (H)(nLogn).


• All elements in the array are the same;

Insertion  sort, all elements are sorted so no swaps has to be made, this is the best case
with a complexity of O(n).



• You know nothing about the elements in the input array

Merge sort, which has the best worst-case complexity, (H)(nLogn)
