EXERCISE 3.
Stack with array.

- The stack is implemented in the files "StackArray.h" and "StackArray.c".
- The tests for the stack operations are implemented in the file "testOperations.c".
- The tests are implemented in the function "testArrayStack()".  

During the creation of the stack operations I used the debugger to go through the
functions step by step, to ensure they worked correctly. After the operations 
where created and stepped through, I wrote a simple test function to simplify 
further testing.

This test i written in the function "testArrayStack()". The
test is dependent on the predefined integer value "NUM_TEST", wich will 
indicate the numbers of elements pushed to the stack in the beginning of the 
test and later poped. 

There is comments throughout the test function to explain what is tested and how.
The test is only suppose to print something to the output if anything goes wrong 
and in the end where an Overflow error is expected.
