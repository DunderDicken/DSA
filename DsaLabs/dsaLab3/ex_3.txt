Exercise 3.
Querying a binary search tree.

Write the sequence of visit keys, in the tree depicted above, for the following dynamic operations:

search(6):
10->7->3->6

minimum():
10->7->3->1

maximum():
10->20->100

successor (6):
6->3->7

Implement the dynamic set operations: search, minimum, maximum and successor as depicted in
the book chapter 12.2:

- The operations are implemented in "BinarySearchTree.c"
- The tests for all the operations are implemented in "testOperations.c"
- The tests for de opeartions are described in Exercise 1 ( ex_1.txt ).
