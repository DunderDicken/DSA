EXERCISE 1.
Doubly linked list.

- The doubly linked list is implemented in the files "LinkedList.h" and "LinkedList.c".
- The tests for the dynamic set operations are implemented in the file "testOperations.c".
- The tests are implemented in the function "testLinkedList()".  

During the creation of all the dynamic set operations I used the debugger to go 
through the functions step by step, to ensure they worked correctly. After all
the operations where created and stepped through, I started writing a test 
function for all the different operations.

This test i written in the function "testLinkedList()".The test is dependent on
the predefined value "NUM_TEST", wich will indicate the numbers of elements
inserted to the list in the beginning of the test.

The test is divided into 6 different smaller tests, to test all the different operations.
There is comments throughout the test to explain what is tested and how. The test
is only suppose to print something to the output if anything goes wrong, except in
the end of the test. There is also a simple counter that will increase by one for
every failed test.

I thought it was very difficult to write a good test, but I hope this will be
sufficient.
