EXERCISE 5.
Queue with an array.

- The queue is implemented in the files "Queue.h" and "Queue.c".
- The tests for the queue operations are implemented in the file "testOperations.c".
- The tests are implemented in the function "testQueueList()".   

The queue structs and functions for both excercise 4 and 5 are in these files,
it is the "QueueArray" struct and functions that is a part of this exercise.

During the creation of all the dynamic set operations I used the debugger to go 
through the functions step by step, to ensure they worked correctly. After all
the operations where created and stepped through, I started writing a test 
function for all the different operations.

This test i written in the function "testLinkedList()", and uncommenting it in
the main() function of the file "testOperations().c" will run the test. The 
test is dependent on the predefined value "NUM_TEST", wich will indicate the 
numbers of elements inserted to the list in the beginning of the test.

The test is divided into 6 different smaller tests, to test all the different operations.
There is comments throughout the test to explain what is tested and how. The test
is only suppose to print somthing to the output if anything goes wrong, except in
the end of the test. There is also a simple counter that will increase by one for
every failed test.

I thought it was very difficult to write a good test, but I hope this will be
sufficient.



Exercise 5 | Queues II
Implement a queue with an array (pp.235).
• Use dequeue on an empty queue (underflow error).
• Enqueue a few items and then dequeue them. Confirm that the output order is the same as
the input order.
• Enqueue elements until the internal array is completely filled and enqueue another element
(overflow error).
