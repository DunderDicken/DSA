EXERCISE 2.
Insertion sort 2 - array.

-	The insertion sort is implemented in the files "insertion_sort_linkedList.h" and "insertion_sort_linkedList.c"
-	The test of insertion sort is implemented in the file "test_insertion_sort.c" 
-	The test is called from the main function in the file "Source.c"

The test in "test_insertion_sort.c" tests my insertion sort function with 
some of the provided test files in "Sorting problems".

It then takes the sorted list and tests it with the provided test_solution() funtion.
