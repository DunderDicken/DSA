EXERCISE 4.
Queue with linked list.

- The queue is implemented in the files "Queue.h" and "Queue.c".
- The tests for the queue operations are implemented in the file "testOperations.c".
- The tests are implemented in the function "testQueueList()".  

The queue structs and functions for both excercise 4 and 5 are in these files,
it is the "QueueList" struct and functions that is a part of this exercise (nr 4).

The functions for creating, enqueueing, dequeueing and checking if the queue is
empty are all dependent on functions from "LinkedList.h", so I did not do very much
testing of these functions. The biggest difference is in the dequeue and enqueue
functions, where the order in wich elements are returned is important. So this was
tested by stepping through with the debugger and checking that everything was 
working correctly.

The simple test of the Queue is implemented as a function in "testOperations.c" file 
called "testQueList()". Uncommenting "testQueList()" in the main function will
run the test function.

The tests are dependent on the defined integer value 
of NUM_TEST will, this will determine how many numbers are enqueued and dequeued
during the test. There is explaining comments throughout the "testQueList()" 
function to explain what is tested and how.
