EXERCISE 7.
Quick sort 2.

-	Quicksort is implemented in the files "quick_sort.h" and "quick_sort.c"
-	The test for Quicksort is implemented in the file "test_quick_sort.c" 
-	The test is called from the main function in the file "Source.c"
-	The test uses the function "test_sorted_array()" which is implemented in "test_insertion_sort.c"

I mainly used the test function in "test_quick_sort()" to the test the implementation.
The test loads some of the provided test files and prints the result. I also used a couple of
prints in the function during coding to see what was happening.

The test is called from "Source.c" and it will print out the smaller lists, and also
test if the returned sorted array is correct and print the result from that test.
