Exercise 4.
Merge sort 1.

- Explain what is the loop invariant in the Merge procedure used in Merge Sort?

The loop invariant, which is a property that is true before and after every
loop-iteration, is as follows;

The array A[p .. k-1] contains the smallest elements of L[1 .. n1+1] and
R[1 .. n2+1]. These elements are also in sorted order in A[p .. k-1].

The elements in the top position of the L- and R-arrays are the smallest
elements of their respective array which has not yet been copied to A[]. 
The "top position" is L[i] and R[j].

This is true for the for-loop shown in the psudeocode below:

    12 for k <-- p to r do
    13     if L[i] <= R[j]  then
    14			A[k] <-- L[i]
    15			i <-- i + 1

    16     else A[k] <-- R[j]
    17			j <-- j + 1
(I have borrowed this psuedocode from the textbook, p. 32)
