EXERCISE 2.
Insertion sort 2 - array.

-	Insertion sort is implemented in the files "insertion_sort_array.h" and "insertion_sort_array.c"
-	The test of insertion sort is implemented in the file "test_insertion_sort.c" 
-	The test is in the function called "test_insertion_sort_Array()"
-	The test is called from the main function in the file "Source.c"

The test in "test_insertion_sort.c" tests my insertion sort function with 
some of the provided test files in "Sorting problems".It then takes the sorted
list and tests it with the provided test_solution() funtion. 

It will print whether the test was successful or not. There is also a flag "print" in the argument
for the insertion sort function, if this is set to TRUE, the function will print the numbers
before and after the sorting. This is the main method I used to test the sorting function.
