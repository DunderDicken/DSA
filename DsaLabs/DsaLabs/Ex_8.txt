EXERCISE 8.
Stacks VS Queues 1.

-   How can a stack be implemented by using two queues?

One way to do this is by making the Pop() operation take
the most running time:

Let us call our two queues Q1 and Q2. While pushing we keep one queue
empty, let say we start with Q2 empty. All pushed elements are then 
stored in the tail of Q1. The element to pop is always in the tail
of Q1. 

When poping, all elements except the last one (the one in the tail)
is dequeued from Q1 and enqueued to Q2. Then the last remaining elemement
in Q1 is dequeued and returned.

Q1 then becomes the new "empty queue" and vise versa.



-   What would be the running time of the resulting stack operations?

The running time of Push() would be the same as a regular Stack, it would
be 1. The time to Pop() on the other hand would be at least the number
of elements in Q1, it would be at least n.
