EXERCISE 1.
Insertion sort 1 - linked list.

-	The insertion sort is implemented in the files "insertion_sort_linkedList.h" and "insertion_sort_linkedList.c"
-	The test of insertion sort is implemented in the file "test_insertion_sort.c" 
-	The test is called from the main function in the file "Source.c"
-	The insertion sort uses the struct and functions of Linked Lists, defined in "LinkedLIst.c"

The test in "test_insertion_sort.c" tests my insertion sort function with 
some of the provided test files in "Sorting problems". It then takes the sorted 
list and tests it with the provided test_solution() funtion. This test was the main
way i tested my sorting function. I realise that this test is dependent on me
handling the printing correctly, but it seems to be working correclty.

The sorting function has a flag, if the flag is set to TRUE it will print the numbers before and after
sorting. If the flag is set to FALSE when the sorting function is called, it will only display
the result of the test, the "the_sorted_list()" test.
