EXERCISE 1.
Graph Data strucuture

-	The Data structure is implemented in the files 'Graph.h' and 'Graph.c'.
-	The test is implemneted in the  files 'testGraphMatrix.h' and 'testGraphMatrix.c'.
-	The tests is implemented in the function 'testGraphMatrix()'. 
-	These test is called from the Main function in the 'testGraph.c' file.
-	Data structure uses the Linked List from earlier excersises ('LinkedList.c').


The tests for the funtions in the data structures are simple. The test function in
'testGraphMatrix()' uses the defined value 'NUM_OF_VERTICES' and creates a Graph with that many
vertices. Then it does all functions and check that expected values are returned. Three edges
are added to the graph. There is one test with a directed Graph and one with a undirected graph.
