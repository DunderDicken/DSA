The Que with linked list is implemented in the headerfile "Que.h" and the file "Que.c" and the tests are implemented in the main file "testOperations.c".

The test of the Que is implemented as a function in "testOperations.c" file called "testQueList()". Uncommenting "testQueList()" in the main function
will run the tests.

The tests are dependent on the defined number NUM_TEST, the integer value of NUM_TEST will determine how many numbers are enqueued and dequeued during the test.
There is explaining comments in the "testQueList()" function.
